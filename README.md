## Variants

| Variant | QR card slots | IC reader | Headphone jack | AC control panel | Simple construction |

|**Real**  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
|**Simple**| Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
|**Basic** | No | Optional | Optional | Yes | Yes |


- **Real** - arcade replica design and sizing, intended for enthusiasts making a dedicated setup
- **Simple** - same features as Real, but a simpler geometric construction with a smaller footprint
- **Basic** - no card slots, option IC reader and headphone jack, likely what most users will look for

All variants share the same arcade-accurate control panel, and the same spacing/art is used on each
