| Version | QR card slots | IC reader | Headphone jack | AC control panel | Simple construction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**Real**  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

- **Real** - arcade replica design and sizing, intended for enthusiasts making a dedicated setup
- **Simple** - same features as Real, but a simpler geometric construction with a smaller footprint
- **Basic** - no card slots, option IC reader and headphone jack, likely what most users will look for

All versions share the same arcade-accurate control panel, and the same spacing/art is used on each

## Directories

### Art - 2D
Contains Adobe Illustrator files `.ai` for the control and card panels
In addition to working with the 3D models, these are all you need to make a fully handmade controller

`Fonts` contains font files used in the Illustrator documents
In order to make revisions easier, text is not converted to outlines, so install these first

### Models - 3D
Contains Fusion 360 archives `.f3z` of each controller variant
It's recommended to make a new folder for the project in Fusion, then simply import the file
All sub-assembiles (components/parts) will be imported, and can be individually edited or exported as needed

#### Exporting for print/cut

Only the wall/side buttons will have pre-exported `.stl` files in this repo (for now)
For other components, you can export them yourself in whatever format your tools/workshop require
